# Even Realities G2 Smart Glasses - Protocol Documentation

I have been reverse engineering the Even Realities G2 smart glasses BLE protocol. If you are interersted in joining this effort, please do!

## Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| BLE Connection | Working | Standard BLE, no special pairing |
| Authentication | Working | 7-packet handshake sequence |
| Teleprompter | Working | Custom text display confirmed |
| Calendar Widget | Working | Display events on glasses |
| Notifications | Partial | Metadata only (app + count) |
| Even AI | Research | Protocol identified |
| Navigation | Research | High display traffic observed |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/teleprompter
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Display custom text on glasses
python teleprompter.py "Hello from Python!"

# Multi-line text
python teleprompter.py "Line one
Line two
Line three"
```

## Documentation

- [BLE Services & UUIDs](docs/ble-uuids.md) - Complete characteristic mapping
- [Packet Structure](docs/packet-structure.md) - Transport layer format
- [Service Reference](docs/services.md) - All known service IDs
- [Teleprompter Protocol](docs/teleprompter.md) - Text display implementation (Work in Progress)

## Protocol Files

- [proto/](proto/) - Protobuf definitions for payload encoding

## Key Findings

### CRC Algorithm
- **Type**: CRC-16/CCITT
- **Init**: 0xFFFF
- **Polynomial**: 0x1021
- **Scope**: Calculated over payload bytes only (skip 8-byte header)
- **Format**: Little-endian

### Packet Structure
```
[AA] [21] [seq] [len] [01] [01] [svc_hi] [svc_lo] [payload...] [crc_lo] [crc_hi]
```

### Architecture
The G2 uses a dual-channel design:
- **Content Channel** (0x5401): What to display (text, data)
- **Rendering Channel** (0x6402): How to display (positioning, styling)

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Areas needing research:
- Navigation turn-by-turn protocol
- Even AI request/response format
- Translation feature
- Display rendering commands (0x6402)
